## Note
Added support for computing moments and statistics.

Changed doi format (brackets) in DESCRIPTION according to 
comment from Uwe Ligges from 
10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0341:lndats]2.0.co;2
to
10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051%5B0341:lndats%5D2.0.co;2

And changed back to original doi after second comment 
by Uwe Ligges

Changed again to escaped form after email from Kurt Hornik.

Removed link to md file in vignette. (The link worked nice on github but not
for the installed package.)
